# go-vectorDistance

Using the data provided in (https://git.nav.com/mpeterson/go-vectorDistance/blob/master/20180622/20180622_results_searches.csv), this repo tests methods for measuring vector distances. Some of the methods have been implemented by the DandB business search function in Pudge (https://git.nav.com/backend/pudge).

This repo used the library (https://github.com/xrash/smetrics) to calculate vector distances.

## Configuration
 ` go get https://github.com/xrash/smetrics`


  `go run main.go`
